   - Tap "Start New Game" button
   - Listen for "Game starting" test speech
   - Verify sound effects work (button clicks, correct/wrong sounds)
   - Test TTS during quiz questions

2. **Console Verification**:
   - Look for these console messages:
     - "🔊 Mobile device detected"
     - "🔊 Setting up enhanced mobile audio fix..."
     - "✅ AudioContext resumed after user interaction"
     - "🔊 Speech synthesis unlocked successfully"

3. **Audio Context Testing**:
   - Check AudioContext state: `window.audioManager.audioContext.state`
   - Should show "running" after first interaction
   - Verify both Web Audio API and TTS work

**Expected Results**:
- Mobile detection works correctly
- Audio unlocks on first user interaction
- Both sound effects and TTS function
- No audio-related errors in console
- Consistent behavior across mobile browsers

// Test TTS
window.audioManager.speak('Test message', 'en');
window.audioManager.speak('परीक्षण संदेश', 'hi');

// Test sound effects
