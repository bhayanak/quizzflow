# Urgent Fixes - September 8, 2025

## Issues Identified
1. **Audio Interruption**: Audio stops on mouse hover and abruptly during gameplay ✅ FIXED
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Game only shows right half on mobile devices - not playable ✅ FIXED
3. **Hindi Audio**: Hindi TTS not working, still speaking English despite language selection ⚠️ PARTIALLY FIXED

## Progress Summary

### ✅ COMPLETED FIXES
1. **Mobile Responsiveness** 
   - Reduced game resolution from 1200x800 to 1000x700
   - Updated Phaser scale settings for better mobile support (min 600x400, max 1400x1000)
   - Enhanced CSS with proper viewport meta tag and mobile-specific styles
   - Added responsive breakpoints for 768px and 480px screens

2. **Audio Interruption**
   - Added `isSpeaking` state tracking to prevent TTS interruptions
   - Modified `speak()` method to respect ongoing speech unless forced
   - Added hover sound throttling (200ms cooldown) to prevent audio spam
   - Fixed `stopAll()` to properly reset speaking state

3. **Hindi TTS Language Switching**
   - AudioManager now listens to language change events
   - Added `setLanguage()` method to AudioManager
   - TTS voice selection now correctly switches to Hindi when language is changed

### ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUE
**Question Content Translation**: While TTS now speaks in Hindi, the question and answer text content is still in English because:
- Question database (JSON files) only contains English content
- Full Hindi implementation would require translating ~30,000+ questions
- Only sample translations exist in translations.json

### Next Steps for Complete Hindi Support
1. Implement dynamic translation service integration
2. Add Hindi question database
3. Translate all categories and difficulty levels
4. Update QuestionManager to load translated content
